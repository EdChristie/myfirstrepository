My first rep on github, in the context of my IBM Coursera course on Data Science
The specific course is the Applied Data Science Capstone
So I'll be adding content here as I progress

Update 12 June 2020: Coursera course - Capstone project
Title
Comparing commuter belt locations around Brussels, Belgium

Introduction/Business Problem
The goal is to produce an application that carries out cluster analyses of locations around cities - with the specific case of Brussels, Belgium as an example - and using Foursquare data on venues such as shops and stores as a base. The geographical scope is commuter belt locations, that is, locations whose distances from the centre of a designated major city are within a specified range (e.g. at least 10 kilometres, not more than 25 kilometres).
Potential applications for this type of analysis may include, among others, providing comparisons between commuter belt locations for purposes of real estate market analyses (for both real estate agents and for their customers) or for market research purposes, e.g. market gap analyses
The application developed here will be simplified and will use only K-Means clustering, rather than more elaborate modelling techniques, so the application should be seen as a work in progress, in the context of the IBM Applied Data Science Capstone course on Coursera.
The preliminary output of this assignment will simply be a map of the region around Brussels, with colour-coded clusters.

Data section
The application will use two datasets. The first is a freely available dataset covering all of the municipalities in Belgium, including their names and geographic coordinates (source: github user jief). The second will be an extract from Foursquare, covering commercial outlets in selected municipalities in Belgium, which will be obtained through a standard API request.
